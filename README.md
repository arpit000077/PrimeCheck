# PrimeCheck

Just a unique beta app to check the prime-ness (duh!) of an input (number), and to optionally provide prime factors of the number.

I'm new to android development, and this is my first (and quite bare) app.

Some points to notice :
---> I can't update it regularly, since it is just my hobby, and work on such stuff in my (quite rare) free time.
---> Not completely developed. Crashes on huge numbers that the app isn't programmed to handle.
