# PrimeCheck

----------
Intro :
----------
Hi guys! I am new to Android app development and I just started off by making a simple app that takes a number as input, and calculates whether that number is prime or not. It can also prime-factorise the number.
How it started : I am a student and while solving various problems, I need to calculate factors of some numbers. I couldn't find any app for that, so I made one myself. :D

---------
Info :
---------
Calculation time depends on the length of the number, and the number of factors it has. Might even crash for ultra-large numbers that the app has not been programmed to handle.
CURRENTLY ALGORITHM IS OPTIMIZED ONLY FOR <10 DIGIT NUMBERS. LARGER NUMBERS WILL/MIGHT TAKE TIME TO CALCULATE.

----------
Note :
----------
Since it is a totally beginner-level app, I am just learning.
DO NOT EXPECT ME TO UPDATE IT REGULARLY. THIS IS JUST MY HOBBY AND DO IT IN FREE TIME.
